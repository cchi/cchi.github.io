What is Machine Learning?

Over at medium.com, Adam Geitgey published a wonderful two-part series "Machine Learning is Fun!". He provides a solid overview while providing interesting examples.

Yesterday, I read <a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-2-a26a10b68df3">Machine Learning is Fun! Part 2</a>, and it was one of the best walkthroughs I've read! In Part 2, he begins describing weights of an input/output algorithm, works up to an explanation of a neural network, and ends with intriguing examples of randomly generated text and Super Mario levels.

Also check out <a href="">Machine Learning is Fun! Part 1</a>.

> Unfortunately "Machine Figuring out an equation to solve a specific problem based on some example data" isnâ€™t really a great name. So we ended up with "Machine Learning" instead.
