Welcome to my Data Science blog!

I decided to invest time into creating a website to publish some of my thoughts and musings - particularly around data, data science, machine learning. I plan on updating this blog with my personal thoughts and analysis. Quite often, I have a neat idea that pops into my head; there simply are limitless applications in today's world, and it really is a fascinating time in this field. Join me on this journey, as I explore intriguing topics such as NLP/NLG, classifiers, neural networks, beautiful visualizations, to name a few.

"Chialities" just sounded right to me â€“ something of a concept that makes up who I am. Knowledge, beliefs, skills, and experiences of me, Charles Chi.

My site is hosted on GitHub, in my repository [cchi.github.io](https://github.com/cchi/cchi.github.io), utilizing the powerful "GitHub Pages" paired with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). From [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/):

> In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers some other advanced templating features.

Stay tuned for more updates!
