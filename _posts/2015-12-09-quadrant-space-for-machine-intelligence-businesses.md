This TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/26/machine-intelligence-in-the-real-world/" target="_blank">article</a> authored by Shivon Zilis of Bloomberg Beta describes the current (and future) space of machine intelligence companies in the real world. I thought it was very cool reading about the various players in the machine learning space. Definitely go check out full descriptions of the different types of buisnesses. Here's some highlight summaries

> - Panopticons: Large scale data collection, covers a broad spectrum on a global scale.
> - Lasers: Focused data collection, with proprietary algorithms and user interface to provide value.
> - Alchemists: High integration with client workflows to draw insights on their data.
> - Gateways: Consultory services for enterprises specialized in new and particular types of data.
> - Magic Wands: Automates workflows and boosts efficency using with domain-specific data.
> - Navigators: Forges autonomous systems and infrastructure in areas like transportation and logistics.
> - Agents: Builds robots to assist in workflows and unlock higher-level human creativity.
> - Pioneers: Extremely smart team with goal to solve problems that that seem impossible.

These descriptions prompted me to create a quick quadrant visualization of where each would fit on two spectrums, Focuses/Broad and Consultative/Autonomous, forming a quadrant:
