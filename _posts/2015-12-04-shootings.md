Research on US Mass Shootings

It is very unfortunate to hear of these incidents, and it seems like these events happen more frequently as of late. I wanted to perform a little bit of research on this topic, particularly locations and basic analysis. 

I found a Mother Jones' open dataset for download here: <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data" target="_blank">US Mass Shootings, 1982-2015: Data From Mother Jones' Investigation</a> as a starting point. In addition, I discovered another dataset <a href="http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015" target="_blank">Mass Shootings in 2015 Data</a> which I utilized for geolocation plotting towards the end of the notebook.

Find my entire walkthrough and code here:
